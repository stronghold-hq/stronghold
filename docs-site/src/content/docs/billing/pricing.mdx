---

Stronghold uses a simple **pay-per-request** model. There are no subscriptions, no tiers, and no API keys. You pay for what you use, and every request costs the same.

## Per-Request Cost

Both scanning endpoints cost **$0.001 per request** (1000 microUSDC):

| Endpoint | Cost | microUSDC |
|----------|------|-----------|
| `/v1/scan/content` | $0.001 | 1000 |
| `/v1/scan/output` | $0.001 | 1000 |

Payment is made via the [x402 protocol](/billing/x402/) using USDC on **Base** (EVM) or **Solana**. No minimum balance is required.

## Money Format

All canonical money fields in API responses are **string-encoded microUSDC integers**. One microUSDC equals 0.000001 USDC.

| microUSDC value | USDC equivalent |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| `"1000"` | $0.001 |
| `"100000"` | $0.10 |
| `"1000000"` | $1.00 |

Strings are used instead of floats to avoid rounding errors in financial calculations.

## Proxy Costs

The transparent proxy uses the same per-scan pricing. Every HTTP/HTTPS request that passes through the proxy is scanned and paid for automatically from your locally-stored wallet. There is no additional markup for proxy usage.

## Low Balance Warning

The web dashboard displays a warning when your wallet balance drops below **1 USDC**. You can check your balance at any time with the CLI:

```bash
stronghold account balance
```

## Check Pricing Programmatically

Query the pricing endpoint directly to get current costs:

```bash
curl https://api.getstronghold.xyz/v1/pricing
```

Sample response:

```json
{
  "currency": "USDC",
  "network": "base",
  "networks": ["base", "solana"],
  "routes": [
    {
      "path": "/v1/scan/content",
      "method": "POST",
      "price_micro_usdc": "1000",
      "price_usd": 0.001,
      "description": "Content scanning for prompt injection detection"
    },
    {
      "path": "/v1/scan/output",
      "method": "POST",
      "price_micro_usdc": "1000",
      "price_usd": 0.001,
      "description": "Output scanning for credential leak detection"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `network` field shows the primary payment network, while `networks` lists all supported chains. Each route includes both the string-encoded integer `price_micro_usdc` and the human-readable `price_usd` equivalent.
