## One-Line Installer

The fastest way to install Stronghold is with the install script. This downloads pre-built binaries for your platform and places them in `/usr/local/bin/`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://getstronghold.xyz/install.sh | sh
```

The script detects your OS and architecture automatically (Linux and macOS, amd64 and arm64).

## Build from Source

If you prefer to build from source, clone the repository and compile with Go:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yv-was-taken/stronghold.git
cd stronghold
go build -o stronghold ./cmd/cli
go build -o stronghold-proxy ./cmd/proxy
sudo mv stronghold stronghold-proxy /usr/local/bin/
```

This produces two binaries:

| Binary | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `stronghold` | CLI client for setup, management, and wallet operations |
| `stronghold-proxy` | Transparent proxy daemon that intercepts and scans traffic |

## System Requirements

- **Operating system**: Linux or macOS
- **Privileges**: Root/sudo access is required for `install`, `enable`, and `disable` commands (these modify firewall rules and system services)
- **Firewall**: iptables or nftables on Linux, pf on macOS
- **Keyring** (Linux only): One of gnome-keyring, KWallet, or pass must be available for secure wallet storage

## Verify Your Environment

After installation, run the built-in diagnostic tool to confirm everything is set up correctly:

```bash
stronghold doctor
```

This checks for:

- Operating system compatibility
- Root/admin privileges
- Firewall tools (iptables/nftables on Linux, pf on macOS)
- Port availability
- Configuration file
- Proxy binary
- CLI binary
- Kernel modules (Linux)
- NFTables backend (Linux)

Fix any issues `doctor` reports before proceeding.

## Next Step

Once installation is verified, run `sudo stronghold init` to create your account, set up your wallet, and configure the proxy. See [Setup & Init](/proxy/setup) for details.
