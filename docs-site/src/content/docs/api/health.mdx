title: Health Checks
description: API health check endpoints for monitoring and orchestration.

Stronghold exposes three health check endpoints. None of them require authentication.

## GET /health

Full health status including service dependency checks.

```bash
curl https://api.getstronghold.xyz/health
```

### Response (200)

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "services": {
    "api": "up",
    "database": "up",
    "x402": "up"
  },
  "timestamp": 1708300000
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `status` | string | `"healthy"` when all dependencies are up, `"degraded"` if any dependency is unhealthy |
| `version` | string | API server version |
| `services` | object | Per-service status (see values below) |
| `timestamp` | number | Unix timestamp of the check |

### Service status values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `"up"` | Service is healthy and reachable |
| `"down"` | Service is unreachable or failing health checks (database) |
| `"not_configured"` | Service is not configured (e.g. no database or no facilitator URL set) |
| `"unreachable"` | HTTP connection to the service failed (x402 facilitator) |
| `"error"` | Service responded with a 5xx status code (x402 facilitator) |

Any status other than `"up"` causes the overall status to become `"degraded"`.

## GET /health/live

Kubernetes **liveness** probe. Returns `200` if the API process is running. This endpoint
does not check downstream dependencies.

```bash
curl https://api.getstronghold.xyz/health/live
```

### Response (200)

```json
{"status": "alive"}
```

## GET /health/ready

Kubernetes **readiness** probe. Returns `200` if the database and x402 facilitator are
reachable. Returns `503` if any required dependency is unavailable.

```bash
curl https://api.getstronghold.xyz/health/ready
```

### Response (200)

```json
{"status": "ready"}
```

### Response (503)

Database unavailable:

```json
{
  "status": "not_ready",
  "reason": "database_unavailable",
  "database": "down"
}
```

x402 facilitator unavailable:

```json
{
  "status": "not_ready",
  "reason": "x402_unavailable",
  "x402": "unreachable"
}
```

The `x402` field will contain one of the non-`"up"` service status values described
above (e.g. `"unreachable"`, `"error"`, `"not_configured"`).

Use `/health/ready` in load balancer health checks and Kubernetes readiness probes to
prevent routing traffic to instances that cannot serve requests.
