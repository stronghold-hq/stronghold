### account deposit

## Deposit Methods

There are three ways to fund your account:

1. **Dashboard** (recommended) -- use Stripe through the web dashboard for fiat-to-USDC conversion
2. **Direct transfer (Base)** -- send USDC on the Base network directly to your EVM wallet address
3. **Direct transfer (Solana)** -- send USDC on Solana directly to your Solana wallet address
