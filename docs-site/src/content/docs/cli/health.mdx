`stronghold health` checks the availability of the Stronghold API and the blockchain RPC endpoints used for payments.

## Usage

```bash
stronghold health
```

No root required.

## Checks Performed

1. **Stronghold API** -- pings the `/health` endpoint on the API server
2. **Base RPC** -- checks the Base (EVM) blockchain RPC endpoint
3. **Solana RPC** -- checks the Solana blockchain RPC endpoint

## RPC Statuses

Each RPC endpoint reports one of the following:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| up | Endpoint is healthy and responding normally |
| congested | Endpoint is responding but with elevated latency |
| down | Endpoint is unreachable or returning errors |

If any endpoint reports `down`, payments on that chain may fail until the issue is resolved.
