title: "enable / disable"
description: "Start and stop the Stronghold transparent proxy."
---

After initial setup with `stronghold init`, use `enable` and `disable` to control the proxy without re-running the full setup process.

## enable

```bash
sudo stronghold enable
```

Starts the proxy daemon and configures kernel-level firewall rules (iptables/nftables on Linux, pf on macOS) to intercept all HTTP and HTTPS traffic. Once enabled, every outbound request on the machine passes through Stronghold for scanning.

## disable

```bash
sudo stronghold disable
```

Removes the firewall rules and stops the proxy daemon. Traffic immediately returns to direct internet access with no interception.

## Root Required

Both commands require root/sudo because they modify kernel-level firewall rules. Running without sudo will fail with a permission error.

## Transparent Interception

The proxy operates at the kernel level using firewall rules, not the `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables. This means it cannot be bypassed by applications -- even a compromised agent cannot disable or circumvent the scanning by unsetting environment variables.
