`stronghold doctor` runs a series of system checks to verify that your machine meets all requirements for running the Stronghold proxy. Run this before `stronghold init` to catch issues early.

## Usage

```bash
stronghold doctor
```

No root required.

## Checks Performed

| Check | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Operating system | Linux or macOS required |
| Root/admin privileges | Verifies sudo or root access is available |
| Firewall tools | iptables/nftables on Linux, pf on macOS |
| NFTables backend (Linux) | Checks whether nftables is the active firewall backend; if so, uses nft-based rules instead of iptables |
| Kernel modules | Required modules loaded (Linux only) |
| Available ports | Port 8402 must be free |
| Configuration permissions | Write access to configuration directories |
| Binary installations | Presence of `stronghold` and `stronghold-proxy` binaries |

## Output

Each check reports a pass or fail status. If any check fails, the output explains what is needed to resolve the issue -- for example, a missing package to install or a port conflict to resolve.

Run `stronghold doctor` again after making corrections to confirm everything passes before proceeding with `stronghold init`.
