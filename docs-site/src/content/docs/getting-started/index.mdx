Stronghold is a pay-per-request AI security scanning platform that protects AI agents from **prompt injection attacks** and **credential leaks**. It is built on the [Citadel](https://github.com/TryMightyAI/citadel) AI security scanner and uses the [x402](https://www.x402.org/) HTTP payment protocol for frictionless, per-request billing.

## The Problem

AI agents interact with untrusted content from the internet — web pages, API responses, user messages, tool outputs. This content can contain **prompt injection attacks** that hijack the agent's behavior, or the agent itself can inadvertently leak **credentials and sensitive data** in its responses.

Traditional security approaches require the agent to call a scanning API *after* it has already read the content. But if the content contains a prompt injection, the agent may have already been compromised before it gets a chance to check.

## How Stronghold Solves It

Stronghold provides **bidirectional protection** at the network level:

```
External content -> [PROXY scans] -> Agent -> [API scans] -> Output
                     |                         |
                  Injection               Credential leaks
                  (INCOMING)              (OUTGOING)
```

- **Incoming content** is scanned for prompt injection by the transparent proxy *before* it reaches the agent. The agent never sees malicious content.
- **Outgoing responses** are scanned for credential leaks by the API *before* they leave the system.

This two-way architecture means attacks are caught at the perimeter, not inside the agent's reasoning loop.

## Components

Stronghold has three components:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **API Server** | Go/Fiber HTTP service that performs 4-layer security scanning. Accepts x402 payments per request. |
| **CLI Client** | Cobra/Bubbletea command-line tool for system setup, proxy management, wallet operations, and account management. |
| **Transparent Proxy** | Network-level traffic interceptor that routes all HTTP/HTTPS traffic through Stronghold scanning before it reaches the agent. |

## 4-Layer Scanning

Every scan request passes through up to four detection layers, from fastest to most thorough:

1. **Heuristic** — Pattern matching against known injection signatures. Sub-millisecond.
2. **ML Classification** — Citadel/Hugot neural network classifier. ~5ms.
3. **Semantic Similarity** — Embedding-based comparison against known attack patterns. ~10ms.
4. **LLM Analysis** (optional) — Any OpenRouter-compatible LLM reasoning about intent. ~500ms.

Each layer produces a score. The scores combine into a final **decision**: `ALLOW`, `WARN`, or `BLOCK`.

## Open Source and Self-Hostable

Stronghold is MIT licensed. You can use the hosted service at `api.getstronghold.xyz` or deploy the entire stack yourself. See the [Self-Hosting](/self-hosting) guide for details.
